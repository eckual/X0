This Unity project brings the classic XO game to life.

Players can take turns placing their symbols (X or O) on a 3x3 grid, aiming to create a winning pattern. 

They can choose to play against an AI bot or challenge a friend in the 2 players mode.
I'm thrilled to bring vibrant animations and innovative features.
I also plan to publish it on the Play Store & app store for everyone to experience as soon as possible.
