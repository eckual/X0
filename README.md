This Unity project brings the classic XO game to life. Players take turns placing their symbols (X or O) on a 3x3 grid, aiming to create a winning pattern. They can choose to play against an AI bot or challenge a friend in the 2 players mode.

I am working hard to enhance the game and make it even more enjoyable. By the end of this journey, in the upcoming phases of development, I'm thrilled to bring vibrant animations and innovative features.

I also plan to publish it on the Play Store for everyone to experience.
