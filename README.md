This Unity project brings the classic XO game to life. Players take turns placing their symbols (X or O) on a 3x3 grid, aiming to create a winning pattern. They can choose to play against an AI bot or challenge a friend in the 2 players mode.

I'm thrilled to bring vibrant animations and innovative features.

I also plan to publish it on the Play Store for everyone to experience soon.
